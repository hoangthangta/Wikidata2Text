We do the task of translating Wikidata claims or statements, organized as a set of triples or quadruples to Wikipedia sentences. This paper will be submitted to http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/ soon. Please check the guideline to follow when we publish our paper. The code is mainly about the data mapping process.

# Data
